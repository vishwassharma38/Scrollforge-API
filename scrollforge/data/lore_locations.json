    "lore": "Long before the forging of crowns or the birth of mortal empires, Varkuun Hollow was a scar in the flesh of the world — a place torn open by the gods' quarrels, where fire bled from the earth in defiance of the cold void. Here, beneath obsidian cliffs and storm-wracked skies, the Ashkai were born. Not from wombs, but from ritual and ruin — shaped in the cauldron of ancestral flame and bound to a spiritual plane known as the Cinderveil. The Hollow was not always this… scarred. In the Age of First Sparks, it was known as Velkaruun, a realm of crystal forests and slow-burning dawns. But during the Great Fracture, when the Titans sundered the leylines to claim dominion, Varkuun was shattered. Lava swallowed the valleys, storms howled through broken spires, and the earth bled continuously. The Ashkai, rather than fleeing, embraced the torment. To suffer was to awaken. To burn was to remember. Their mystics learned to read the memories of fire, their warriors danced in the molten rain, and their dead were laid not in tombs, but in Lavasoul Crypts, where their ashes could whisper across generations.",

They bound their fate to thunder, singing oaths to the Hall of Horns, where the honored dead feast eternally in the company of storm-spirits. When the Ice Giants ruled, Hjarnheim groaned under their titanic weight. But Skeld Frostmaul shattered their reign, wielding skyfire and defiance. From this uprising, the Brakyr carved a new dawn — not of peace, but of enduring storm, bound by strength, saga, and steel. Even now, the land remembers. Frostbound cairns hum with old power, and the Everthrone echoes with the weight of unsung prophecies.

The Sandmother's children turned toward grit and survival, while the Moon-Weaver’s kin vanished into veiled groves, chasing forgotten echoes. Zehrathel is a land of scent and shadowplay. A place where perfume carries memory, where maps are painted in oil and dream. Here, even silence has a taste — like salt, like citrus, like longing. Every footstep is a prayer offered to shifting sands, and every breath is a story carried on the breeze. The Canari still dance at moonrise, crafting fragrances that remember what voices forget.

Kharnovar was the anvil upon which their culture was struck: unyielding, honor-bound, and seared with the legacy of war. In the Age of Smoke and Stone, the mountain veins flowed rich with emberore and godsteel. The Nine Great Clans rose from the molten deeps, each binding their fates to the flame. They did not worship gods — they *challenged* them, daring the divine to earn their reverence in battle or craft. Kings were crowned not with jewels, but with scar-marks and forged vows. Their halls rang with the clang of oaths — and betrayal echoed louder than death. The Crucible Wars reshaped the highlands. In the cataclysmic siege of Mourngate, the Dravok cast down the Titanborn legion by flooding the Hollowmarch with searing slag. At Thulgrim’s Pyre, a dying king smelted his own bones into relics, gifting his clan a final warcry. And in the Redstone Accord, the once-warring clans hammered a treaty on an altar of molten iron — a pact sealed with burnt hands and broken blades. Kharnovar is no longer a kingdom — it is a legacy. Its vaults echo with buried wrath, and its forges still pulse with ember-blood.
