    "story": "Long before the cities rose and the high towers glittered, a group of outcasts, debtors, and deserting soldiers formed a secret ring in the alley-ruins of Virellia. Bartering stolen relics, contraband herbs, and secrets, they called themselves only by the symbol they carved into the bricks— a coin etched with a hole in the center. The hole meant silence. The coin meant value. Their creed became law: \"Speak nothing. Take everything. Leave no debt unpaid.\" Today, The Hollow Coin is less a guild, more a subterranean network: smugglers, fences, pickpockets, master forgers, and shadow merchants. They operate through coded gestures, marked alley stones, and shifting hideouts—many hidden beneath the marketplaces of major cities.",
